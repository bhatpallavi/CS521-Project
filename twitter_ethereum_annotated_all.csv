1300641575794401280,"@kaiynne @VitalikButerin Part of why I joined Ethereum in the first place is the positive, welcoming community so just trying to share my thoughts as I read through a thread like this",Positive,2020-09-01 03:48:11+00:00,ljxie
1300639026798501888,@VitalikButerin I feel like phrasing a question this way encourages people to pile on and can potentially be discouraging to teams esp those working hard towards building on Ethereum. Maybe we can focus on what are ways to improve existing popular DeFi projects or something along those lines?,Positive,2020-09-01 03:38:03+00:00,ljxie

1300084034068836355,I‚Äôm excited about the fair launches in Ethereum. We‚Äôll continue to see many more of them become successful. We‚Äôll also continue to see founders raise from VCs but likely the trend being much smaller rounds to get to launch with lower caps per investor which IMO is a good thing!,Positive,2020-08-30 14:52:42+00:00,ljxie
1298782583233196032,@mattleising I‚Äôm surprised you wrote a book on the story of Ethereum if you think an idea like this is not okay to share publicly. Tons of interesting governance discussions and experiments happening in Ethereum every day :),Positive,2020-08-27 00:41:12+00:00,ljxie
1292737501476446209,@harrycanuck It‚Äôs all about memes. Bitcoin has the digital gold meme right now and most traditional investors are far likelier to hold BTC in their portfolio than ETH.

1292724079888277506,"@antiprosynth Yes, I would argue that there will be significant changes to the protocol over time which is a subset of what is discussed e.g. staking, scaling solutions, supply. This is a good thing for Ethereum",Positive,2020-08-10 07:26:52+00:00,ljxie
1292722724310261761,@antiprosynth I‚Äôm not referring to just the app layer. Ethereum community is far more open to changing significant aspects of the core protocol which always leaves more room for potential issues.

1292721420074496000,@antiprosynth I personally don‚Äôt want my digital gold to be doing all kinds of experiments. Keeping it simple and less prone to attacks/issues is a very good thing and will make traditional investors searching for a hedge feel more comfortable.

1292719011361218560,"Still don‚Äôt get the Bitcoin vs Ethereum debates. Bitcoin acts as a better digital gold. There‚Äôs known supply, conservative changes, resonates w/ traditional investors.

1292181306642558976,"Tokenized BTC seems clearly good for both Bitcoin and Ethereum to me.

1289644761029042176,I don't normally post about crypto prices but it makes me really happy to see this ETH rally.
